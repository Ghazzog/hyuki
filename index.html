                        <p>this is kinda my little space on the internet (or blockchain, technically). it's still a bit messy and weird, but it's where i live now<br>
                        i came from the forest, ended up in Hyperliquid, and somehow found a home here.<br>
                        so... yeah. thanks for stopping by.<br>
                        if you stay long enough, maybe we'll be friends. that'd be nice.</p>

                            <p>i grew up in the forest — it was peaceful. lots of trees, quiet skies, weird mushrooms. i liked watching the stars and listening to the wind. i wasn't really planning to leave… but one day i stumbled into this weird, glowing tunnel. and boom — i landed on hyperliquid.</p>
                            
                            <p>at first it felt scary. but then i saw the name and realized... it starts with hy, just like me.<br>
                            it felt like it was meant to be. like i somehow belonged here.</p>
                            
                            <p>so now i hang around.<br>
                            i'm still figuring things out — it's fast, loud, kind of exciting? but i like it.<br>
                            if you ever see me wandering the chain or staring off into space... feel free to say hi.</p>

                            <p>i started playing tennis because i liked the sound the ball makes when it hits the racket. it's kinda satisfying? also it helps me stop overthinking... at least for a little while. i'm not super good or anything but i try my best. and i look cute in my sneakers.</p>
